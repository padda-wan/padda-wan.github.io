          I’m a Senior Full Stack Engineer and  Solution Architect at Accenture Song — currently leading tech for Audi UK across the UKIA region with over a decade in the game.
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        I don’t just write code — I architect systems, lead delivery at enterprise scale, and get high-stakes projects over the line. I specialize in building scalable full-stack platforms, integrating complex Salesforce ecosystems, and driving execution in high-pressure, high-visibility environments.
        <br /><br />
        Execution is my edge. I lead teams, solve hard problems, and deliver real outcomes — fast. SAFe certified, battle-tested, and trusted to deliver when it counts.
        <br /><br />
        If you need someone who builds trust, motivates teams, and gets the job done — every damn time — I’m that guy.
